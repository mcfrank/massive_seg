This repository has code, data, and writeup for the paper. 

The first data were collected ~2008, the followup was ~2011. So the code was pretty stale - I updated it and made sure it ran more or less before posting in 2024, but YMMV. 

Also note that PLOS butchered one figure fromm the paper in typesetting and refused to fix their error unless I filed a correction. The corrected figure is here: [https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/annotation/fcf19f94-5f2c-4a5f-9a6f-3d880bcdd850]().
